# electrocam

This is a minimal Electron application for testing your webcam.

It doesn't use flash, just:
- `HTML5` - It uses a `<video>` and `<canvas>` tags.
- `navigator.getUserMedia()` API - Requesting local media to the user including Audio and Video.
- `More javascript` - Just some code placed together with <3.
